			<h1>My Projects</h1>
			<p class="lead">Hi! This is where all of my coding projects will be given a description about them.</p>
		</div>

		<div>	
			<h3>League-in-a-Box</h3>
			<p>League-in-a-Box is a technical kit that is aimed at providing an easy to use
				 and accessible way for FIRST Tech Challenge event hosts to set up their scoring networks and broadcast live streams. 
				I co-developed this system with others in the North Texas FIRST Tech Challenge region.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Dozer</h3>
			<p>Dozer is currently where I focus my development time. Dozer is a collaborative project that multiple
				developers (myself included) work on.
				Dozer is written in Python, and is a moderation/general purpose bot for Discord servers related to
				FIRST. You can check out the main repository
				<a href=https://github.com/FRCDiscord/Dozer>here</a>, or my fork (where I work on my code) <a
						href=https://github.com/tweirtx/Dozer>here.</a></p>
		</div>

		<h2>Older Projects</h2>

		<div>
			<h3>DownBot</h3>
			<p>I wrote a bot that allows for autofailover for Discord bots. My primary intention is for it to do Dozer
				redundancy, however I'd love to see
				other bot projects using it. I originally wrote the bot in Python, but couldn't get subprocess to behave
				properly so I wrote it
				in node.js so I could use pm2. You can find it <a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/DownBot'>here.</a>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>5052 Scouter</h3>
			<p>This is a scouting app I wrote for my FRC team, team 5052. We couldn't find an existing solution that met
				our needs, so I took it upon myself to write an app using Cordova. This project also taught me
				that JavaScript is painful. you can find the code <a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/5052-scouter'>here.</a>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Sumo Bots</h3>
			<p>Some simple RobotC that reacts to remote signals for FRC team 5052's sumo
				bots. The code can be found <a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/sumo-bots'>here.</a></p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Avatar to PNG</h3>
			<p>This is a Python microservice that takes requests for FRC team avatars, pulls the base64 for the avatar, and
				caches it as PNG. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/tweirtx/frcavatars">here</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>DebateBot</h3>
			<p>This was a Discord bot that structures debates. The bot is written in Python, and code can be found <a
					href='https://github.com/tweirtx/debatebot'>here</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>LemmeIn</h3>
			<p>This is a Flask-based Slack bot that is used to know when people need to be let in to the building at
				robotics meetings. It serves up a form where
				the user is asked for their name and which door they're at, then the input is sent to a Slack channel.
				It's written in Python and can be found
				<a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/LemmeIn'>here</a></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>ReMatch</h3>
			<p>ReMatch was a Python system that takes a recording of an event, does some math, and splits out individual
				clips of each match at the event. You can find its code <a href="https://github.com/tweirtx/ReMatch">here.</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>TimeTracker</h3>
			<p>TimeTracker is an efficient way to track hours for your robotics team or club. It can be run either as a
				web server or as a CLI.
				You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/tweirtx/timetracker">here.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div>
