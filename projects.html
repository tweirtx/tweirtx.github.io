			<h1>My Projects</h1>
			<p class="lead">Hi! This is where all of my coding projects will be given a description about them.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Dozer</h3>
			<p>Dozer is currently where I focus my development time. Dozer is a collaborative project that multiple
				developers (myself included) work on.
				Dozer is written in Python, and is a moderation/general purpose bot for Discord servers related to
				FIRST. You can check out the main repository
				<a href=https://github.com/FRCDiscord/Dozer>here</a>, or my fork (where I work on my code) <a
						href=https://github.com/tweirtx/Dozer>here.</a></p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>SnuWumpus</h3>
			<p>This was my first ever Discord bot. It takes a Reddit inbox and allows Discord community moderation teams
				to make invitations from requests on Reddit. v1.0 is terrible and
				won't be posted, but I have a v2.0 <a href=https://github.com/tweirtx/SnuWumpus>here</a></p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>This website</h3>
			<p>This should be an easy one to figure out, you're on it right now! I made this using templates and CSS
				from Bootstrap but wrote the HTML myself.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>8th grade Gateway projects</h3>
			<p>In my 8th grade year, I was lucky enough to participate in the PLTW Gateway to Engineering class. Most of
				what came out of that from me was horrible CAD models and engineering drawings, but
				we did also do some RobotC with VEX. I've uploaded those, because that's the part I was actually good
				at. You can find them <a href=https://github.com/tweirtx/gateway-projects>here</a>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Freshman Computer Science</h3>
			<p>In my freshman year of high school, I've been taking computer science. I made a lot of random crap, but
				<a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/cCezjJLTCtwRHiGuCeF3BM5I81_b0EfH9Z3IERXMbgc">this</a>
				is my semester 1 final project, written in Javascript.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>DownBot</h3>
			<p>I wrote a bot that allows for autofailover for Discord bots. My primary intention is for it to do Dozer
				redundancy, however I'd love to see
				other bot projects using it. I originally wrote the bot in Python, but couldn't get subprocess to behave
				properly so I wrote it
				in node.js so I could use pm2. You can find it <a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/DownBot'>here.</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>5052 Scouter</h3>
			<p>This is a scouting app I wrote for my FRC team, team 5052. We couldn't find an existing solution that met
				our needs, so I took it upon myself to write an app using Cordova. This project also taught me
				that JavaScript is painful. you can find the code <a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/5052-scouter'>here.</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Sumo Bots</h3>
			<p>There's almost nothing to this. It's some RobotC that reacts to remote signals for FRC team 5052's sumo
				bots. The code can be found <a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/sumo-bots'>here.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Avatar to PNG</h3>
			<p>This is a Python mini-API that takes requests for FRC team avatars, pulls the base64 for the avatar, and
				caches it as PNG. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/tweirtx/frcavatars">here</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>DebateBot</h3>
			<p>This is a Discord bot that structures debates. The bot is written in Python, and code can be found <a
					href='https://github.com/tweirtx/debatebot'>here</a> and the bot
				can be invited <a
						href='https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=423956493214285829&permissions=268437520&scope=bot'>here</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Public Ideas to Trello</h3>
			<p>This is a Discord bot that I wrote for the FRC Discord server that takes public ideas (in a certain
				channel) and puts them in a Trello list.
				I wrote it in Python, and the code can be found <a
						href='https://github.com/tweirtx/public-ideas-to-trello'>here</a>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>LemmeIn</h3>
			<p>This is a Flask-based Slack bot that is used to know when people need to be let in to the building at
				robotics meetings. It serves up a form where
				the user is asked for their name and which door they're at, then the input is sent to a Slack channel.
				It's written in Python and can be found
				<a href='https://github.com/tweirtx/LemmeIn'>here</a></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Discraft</h3>
			<p>This is a Discord bot I wrote in Java. It is installed as a Minecraft Spigot server plugin and updates an
				embed with relevant server info. I chose this
				to force myself to learn some Java. You can find the source code <a
						href='https://github.com/tweirtx/discraft'>here</a>. This project is incomplete and never will
				be complete.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>ReMatch</h3>
			<p>ReMatch is a Python system that takes a recording of an event, does some math, and splits out individual
				clips of each match at the event. You can find its code <a href="https://github.com/tweirtx/ReMatch">here.</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>TimeTracker</h3>
			<p>TimeTracker is an efficient way to track hours for your robotics team or club. It can be run either as a
				web server or as a CLI.
				You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/tweirtx/timetracker">here.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>BroadcastSMS</h3>
			<p>BroadcastSMS is the easy way to distribute information over text message. It's an Android app (written
				with Flutter) that will
				be on the Play Store soon. You can find the source code <a
						href="https://github.com/tweirtx/BroadcastSMS">here.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Streamline-Control</h3>
			<p>Streamline-Control is a GUI that is used in the Streamline project (an initiative to help FTC events
				stream).
				It is written in Python and interacts with GTK. You can find the source <a
						href="https://github.com/bkeeneykid/streamline-control">here.</a></p>

		<div>
			<h3>The Orange Alliance</h3>
			<p>I manage the CI for The Orange Alliance. You can find source code <a
					href="https://github.com/orange-alliance">here</a> and the site itself <a
					href="https://theorangealliance.org">here.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>RulerAPI</h3>
			<p>RulerAPI is an API server and set of clients to get the text of a rule given its reference number.
				The original intent is for FRC, but its use is not limited to it. You can find the source <a
						href="https://github.com/rulerapi">here.</a></p>
